                I completely understand — not every world is for everyone, and sometimes it's just time to move on.
                Thank you so much for having been part of the Explorer’s Circle. I truly appreciate that you took the
                time to sign up and see what Emotive Worldcraft is about.

                If you have 30 seconds, would you consider sending me a quick note about why you chose to unsubscribe?
                Any feedback — big or small — really helps me improve what I share.
            </p>
