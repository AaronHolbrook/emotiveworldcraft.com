                <p class="text-lg">
                    Thank you for joining me. You’re now part of the <em>Explorer’s Circle</em> — a space for those who love
                    to wander through new worlds, uncover hidden stories, and feel every moment of the journey.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg">Here’s what you can expect:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-lg">
                    <li>First notifications of new releases and soundscapes</li>
                    <li>Sneak peeks and early previews before anyone else</li>
                    <li>Behind-the-scenes looks at worldbuilding and concept art</li>
                    <li>Bonus content and hidden lore not shared anywhere else</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    I’ll only write when there’s something worth sharing — no clutter, just new doors opening.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    And remember, this isn’t just a broadcast. If you want to share your thoughts, ideas, or just say
                    hello, you can always hit reply to any email. I’ll be there. I’d love to talk.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    Thank you for helping keep these worlds alive. Welcome — and see you on the other side of the
                    portal.
                </p>
