  <h1>Welcome to Emotive WorldCraft</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Emotive WorldCraft</strong> is a project by <em>Aaron Holbrook</em>, created for people who want to truly feel. This is a growing collection of immersive, short-form experiences that blend music, writing, and art into small, intentional rituals.

  <p>
    Some of these worlds are dark or unsettling. Others are calm, gentle, or reflective. All are designed to invite you in and help you slow down, listen, and step somewhere different, even for just a moment.
  </p>
  <p>
    I made Emotive WorldCraft because I wanted more than just music or writing on their own. I wanted to create places you can step into and come away changed, even in small ways.

    If you value atmosphere, mystery, and emotion, I hope you will feel at home here. Explore the open worlds below and choose your next path.
